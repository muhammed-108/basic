Step 1 Install Redis on an ECS.
Run the following command to install Redis:
yum install -y redis6-6.2.7-1.oe2203.x86_64

After the installation is complete, run the systemctl start redis command to start the
Redis service.

step 2 
redis-cli
Create data in key-value format.
  set test1 openEuler1
  set test2 openEuler2
  set test3 openEuler3

Query all keys in the current database.
  keys *

Run the get command to view the value of a key. For example:
get test1

Run the expire command to set the expiration time of a key. For example:
expire test1 2

Run the move command to migrate a key value to another database. For example:
move test2 1
1 
select 1 

keys *


Step 3 Set a Redis login password.
Modify the Redis configuration file /etc/redis/redis.conf. Uncomment requirepass
foobared (line 903 in the current version) and replace foobared with a password, as
shown in the following figure.
requirepass Huawei@123

After the modification, restart the Redis service and check whether the password takes
effect.

redis-cli
dway ama ish nakat abe password bnusi lagalia
redis-cli -a Huawei@123
inja ish akat

Step 4 Configure Redis persistent storage.
Modify the Redis configuration file, set dbfilename to snapshot.rdb, and set dir to a
directory that stores this file, as shown in the following figure.

dbfilename snapshot.rdb

dir /var/lib/redis

Run the save command to set the RDB policy. In the following figure, 10 indicates that a
snapshot is saved if one key changes within 10 seconds (line 386 in the configuration
file).

save 10 1



After the modification is complete, restart the Redis service, go to Redis, and manually
create two keys. The system creates a snapshot file in the specified directory, as shown in
the following figure.

ls /var/lib/redis/
